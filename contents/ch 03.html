                        <p>Next morning I had a beauty of a hangover. 'Never again!' I thought. At least out on operations there would be no danger of getting into such a state. That morning, Brown departed for Johore Bahru hospital; his facial muscles had become increasingly paralysed and he should have gone sick weeks before, but he was keen to knock off a few more CTs first.</p>

                        <p>After a long spell in hospital he came back to the Jungle Company, but he seemed far from his usual self. Soon afterwards, he applied for the position of a planter on the nearby oil palm estate and was accepted; but when he requested to be released from the Malayan Police Force, they refused unless he bought himself out. Stupidly, he paid. Had he known the ropes, he could have been released for nothing and might even have secured a pension on the grounds of disability. The force certainly had its money's worth from P/Lt Brown. However, all worked out well in the end. He got married and settled down as a planter. It must bring back many memories to him as he goes round the estate where, at one time, he used to fight for his life, but where now, with the end of the guerrilla war in Malaya, all is peaceful - a point the 'memsahib' in the club might not fully appreciate.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section id="platoon-training">
                        <p>My next three weeks were spent in retraining the platoon. The work included map-reading, range work, mock assaults on CT camps, Immediate Action drills (in case of our being ambushed) and other skills that might prove useful in jungle warfare.</p>

                        <p>Goh Peng Tuan had not been kicking his heels while we had been retraining. One night he led the 7th Independent Platoon in an attack on the Yong Peng Home Guard HQ and managed to get away with 20 or more weapons. A platoon of the Fijian Regiment, on the follow-up after the attack, soon located his platoon base. During the assault on the camp, the Fijians had two of their men killed and Goh Peng Tuan and his platoon escaped. CTs feared the courageous Fijians more than any other troops in Malaya. The Fijians' jungle ability was second to none and all of them were like oxen in physique. Their stamina in the hazardous jungle seemed to be inexhaustible. The 7th Independent Platoon must have been feeling rather proud of themselves, I thought, with these successes.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section id="intelligence-briefing">
                        <p>Several days after the Fijian skirmish, Major Golder, the Military Intelligence Officer, arrived at our HQ. He had driven the 40 miles from Segamat, so I knew his visit was important. He was soon telling us news of 0026. My heart seemed to miss a beat, as I knew that the code number was Goh Peng Tuan's. He went on to tell us that 0026 with his platoon, DCMs and their units from about six local villages, would be having their annual conference in about ten days' time, somewhere in the Maokil Forest Reserve. It was expected that there would be approximately 60 well-armed CTs at this meeting. My platoon happened to be the only one available at the time, so I was to go out in search of their camp. What would take place if we happened to come across it could be anyone's guess.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section id="november-patrol">
                        <h3>November 1953</h3>
                        <p>The platoon and I were cautiously slogging our way through the Maokil area. I had an SEP with me and I made him do the difficult and dangerous task of leading scout: if we happened to be ambushed, the first chap would nearly always be the first to be killed, and naturally I would sooner see an ex-CT dead than any of my own men. At one place he pointed out to me where he, along with a strong force of CTs, had ambushed and killed a number of British soldiers some time before. As I walked behind him I noticed his animal-quick instincts and reactions, acquired through years spent being hunted in the jungle. During the Japanese occupation of Malaya, he served with the Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army. In 1948, at the beginning of the Malayan emergency, he joined the communist Malayan Races Liberation Army (the MRLA) and remained in the organization for some years until he finally surrendered himself to one of our sections.</p>

                        <p>We spent a total of four days trekking, every minute on the alert. On the fifth day we made our base camp and DZ. It was situated at the confluence of two small rivers, which gave us a certain amount of natural defence. On the first day we found the tracks of three CTs. We estimated the tracks to be quite fresh, only a few hours old. All our skill was used in trying to follow them, but we failed.</p>

                        <p>Airdrop day arrived. Two parachutes became entangled in the branches of huge trees, one of which we had to fell. Having in our possession only parangs for the job, it took almost three hours. A couple of agile men climbed the other tree and cut free the crate containing the supplies from the parachute. At all times we are at the ready in base camp and whilst out patrolling. All conversation is carried on in whispers. I allow wood-cutting and collecting twigs for lighting fires to be done only one hour of the day, in the early morning. Sounds of wood-cutting travel far in the jungle and many a camp position has been given away by SF and CTs alike through this noise. I curse softly at any man who clangs his mess-tin or water-bottle. 'Stand-to' is carried out religiously each dawn and dusk. We do not intend to be caught with our pants down.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section id="supply-crisis">
                        <p>A week of intense patrolling went by and still we found no further signs of Communists. I began to wonder whether the information we had been given was 'duff'. The day of our airdrop came round once more, but nothing arrived. Wanting to know the reason, I spoke to someone in HQ by radio. I was informed that we had already received our supplies. I almost exploded with rage.</p>

                        <p>'Would I be making inquiries if we had already received them?' I asked.</p>

                        <p>Finally, I was told to expect them the following day.</p>

                        <p>Once again we waited in vain. By then we were almost on a starvation diet. A few men had the odd tin of meat, some had very little rice and an ounce or two of tea. Collecting the bits together, I rationed them out the best I could to the whole platoon. Even the river nearby did not offer us any fish because of its shallowness; the traps and snares which we laid around our camp in the hope of catching some wild animal yielded nothing. A few of the chaps went out in search of anything edible, but all they brought back was a type of fungus similar to our mushroom which grows on the dead trunks of fallen trees. At first I was very reluctant to eat them, but being so ravenously hungry I decided to chance it.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section id="desperate-march">
                        <p>Before first light the following morning the men had packed their kits. There was no cooking to be done, so in a very short time we were on the move - due east; this meant we would be in for some rough terrain. I expected to arrive at the main road before darkness fell in 12 hours' time.</p>

                        <p>For the first hour there was no incident; the men all did exceptionally well in keeping up their spirits. From experience, I knew this could not continue, and that very soon a number of them would start fainting through sheer weakness. Pulling ourselves up the steep and slippery hills was draining us of the little energy we had left. After a while the men began to collapse, not surprisingly as it was now over three days since any of us had eaten. Sergeant Shaffie who, as always, was full of stalwartness, stayed behind with any unfortunate man who went down. He helped him on his way after the man had recovered. Very soon I was burdened with someone else's pack besides my own; the man I took it from was just about on his last legs. As we struggled on, I did all I could to coax the rest of the platoon not to give in.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section id="lost-in-jungle">
                        <p>It was now eleven o'clock. My previous calculations indicated that by 11 am we should have been clear of the jungle-clad hills that were still facing us. However, we continued on our same course. At midday an apprehensive feeling of being lost in this colossal rain forest began to nag at me. I was sure that I'd been using the compass correctly, or had I? Sergeant Shaffie and I discussed the predicament; his thoughts were much the same as mine - we were lost. For a minute or two my thoughts ran wild, thinking of the horrible consequences which might happen to us.</p>

                        <p>We had to get out of that green hell or another day without food would see some of the men unable to carry on. The platoon, I knew, always trusted me to get us out of any such difficulties; we'd shared a number together, but this time I could not guarantee the outcome and I felt wholly responsible for our plight. I was quite confident we were still moving east, which was our course. As we pressed on I consulted my compass more regularly; we deviated maybe a few degrees north or south, but our general direction remained constant.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section id="jungle-curse">
                        <p>By 3 o'clock we were still among the slippery, jungle-covered hills and travelling at a snail's pace. Halting the platoon for a rest, Shaffie and I pondered over our maps, trying to fix our position. As we were so engaged, a member of the platoon came up to us and spoke rapidly to Shaffie. They conversed far too quickly for me to understand fully but, seeing a look of astonishment spread over Shaffie's face, I gathered something was wrong. Climbing to his feet, Shaffie made his way amongst the platoon until he was out of my view. Hearing his raised voice, I went to see if there was any trouble. Shaffie was dressing down one of the men. He turned to me.</p>

                        <p>'This man is responsible for our being lost, Sir, not you.'</p>

                        <p>'Why is that?'</p>

                        <p>He showed me a piece of rotan and a small rock that he had taken off the man. These two articles, he said, are not the ordinary sort, but of a kind which supposedly holds magical powers. Malay people, he continued, never attempt to take them away from the jungle, as they belong to the jungle devil; he will prevent anyone who tries to steal them from leaving his domain.</p>

                        <p>The man told us that he wanted the things to give to his kampong bhomo - village witchdoctor - on his return there. He knew he was taking a chance in trying to bring them out of the jungle. With that, he threw them as far as possible down the hill we'd just climbed. Shaffie and the men were convinced that very soon we should once again be able to fix our position.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section id="final-confrontation">
                        <p>Sure enough, within ten minutes, we found ourselves on a disused woodcutter's track with which we were all familiar. This wasn't the first time I'd come up against the Malays' superstitions, but I still don't understand it. Was it coincidence, or had the 'jungle devil' really freed us? I often wonder. What a relief it was to have shaken off the fear of being lost and to know that within about two hours we should be on the main road. There we would have transport to our HQ, where we could get some food.</p>

                        <p>The SEP, who was the leading scout, suddenly halted without warning. Instinct told me that he had seen something important. Yes, down the track where he was pointing were several nibong trees which had only recently been cut down, probably that same morning; there were also a large number of fresh footprints which must have been left by CTs. I knew they were from the camp we'd been searching for. Neither the men nor myself were in a fit state to launch an assault. Shaffie and I had a short parley on the best thing to do. We both knew it would be useless to take men who were continually fainting, so the only solution was to sort out the fittest men.</p>

                        <p>In all, we mustered nine chaps: Shaffie himself, the SEP, six members of the platoon and me. Nine starving men against 50 tough CTs - what hope had we? But there was no other choice. Shaffie noticed my uneasiness.</p>

                        <p>'Well, Tuan, what do you think? Shall we attack or not?'</p>

                        <p>I glanced at him and said calmly, 'We'll attack the camp.'</p>
                    </section>

                    <section id="final-battle">
                        <p>Before our small outfit moved off, I gave orders for the rest of the platoon not to leave their position under any circumstances until we returned. When that would be, or even how many of us would be returning, I couldn't say; but I had to be certain that any movement we might hear, and any figures we might see, would be from the CTs and not our own men. Shaffie and I took leading scout alternately. We moved slowly and with extreme caution. The track was very easy to follow, as it had been used so many times by many CTs, and I knew we were heading for the lion's den.</p>

                        <p>For a quarter of a mile or more we followed the twists and turns of the track. Our main object was to try to spot their sentry before he spotted us. Every five or six yards we stopped to listen and search for any tell-tale signs of a sentry post.</p>

                        <p>Now it was my turn to lead. I knelt behind some foliage and peered down the track. Systematically I searched first the left side then the right. My nerves were almost at breaking point. All I could see was a tangled mass of greenery. Slowly I climbed to my feet and gingerly moved forward. I had only gone about four paces when, without warning, a shot rang out right ahead. It was their sentry. For a split second my mind went blank: then, springing to my feet, I yelled 'Charge!' and dashed down the track.</p>

                        <p>Before we'd gone 15 yards we came under heavy fire from an assortment of weapons. I threw myself down and shouted to the men to do the same. The enemy's bullets were ripping through the air, far too close for my liking. We exchanged a fusillade. As their firing intensified from the front, it also came from our left and right flanks. They were trying to encircle us ready for the kill. Quickly I regrouped the men, positioning one bren-gun to cover our rear and to open fire at any movement in that direction. It was lucky I had ordered the remainder of the platoon not to move; they would have heard all the firing, but would be helpless to do anything about it. At this point I exchanged my carbine for the other bren-gun. Sergeant Shaffie kept signalling to the men not to bunch together; a hand-grenade thrown by the CTs would inflict several casualties and we could not afford to lose a single man.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section id="standoff">
                        <p>The SEP was the nearest man to me; I could only catch glimpses of the others. They looked grim. Corporal Yacob gave me a weak smile which I returned with a 'thumbs up' sign. Hussain quietly intoned a prayer to Allah. Sergeant Shaffie was his usual cool calm self, and this steadied the whole section.</p>

                        <p>I thought of the 'thin red line' - ours might have been the thin green one! With the bren, I returned the CTs' fire with several short bursts. As I stood there, firing from the hip (the tripods are of no use in close-quarter combat), with the butt recoiling in my hip, I felt somewhat less vulnerable. Then, as though a film director had ordered 'cut', the firing stopped; yet I had given no order. A strong smell of cordite hung in the dank jungle air. As we crouched, expecting them to charge, I checked my hand-grenade and parang. I strained my ears for any tell-tale noise, but all was fearsomely quiet.</p>

                        <p>Then, to my utter astonishment, the unnatural silence was broken, not by the blare from their bugler, followed by a screaming charge, but by a voice calling on us to surrender, as we were trapped and outnumbered. The weird voice echoed through the jungle, taunting us. It seemed so close; but I could see no movement. The SEP gazed at me in terror and jibbered that it was none other than Goh Peng Tuan. He should have known, he served under him; Goh Peng Tuan, commander of the ruthless 7th Independent Platoon, the élite, the crack unit of the Communists in Johore. The 7th must have been full of confidence, after a run of successful engagements against the Security Forces. Only three weeks before they had fought a pitched battle with a full platoon of Security Forces and inflicted very heavy casualties on them. I waited a few seconds before shouting back that we would fight it out, and I underlined my answer with a couple of bursts of bren fire.</p>

                        <p>Their response was much as I expected; they threw everything at us, automatic fire and grenades. The jungle was at that point our only ally. How often I'd cursed it, but I was all praise for it in that situation: the trees, saplings and tangled undergrowth absorbed all their fire; the swampy ground took the impact of the grenades which they hurled at us. Their concentrated firing was scything down branches which fell amongst us.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section id="aftermath">
                        <p>For a few nights after this encounter I had difficulty in sleeping. My mind was in turmoil and I had vivid nightmares. The answer, I thought, might be to return to the scene of the action, and this I did after a few days. I went through the whole thing again, in my mind and on the ground, reliving every tense moment. Afterwards I felt more relaxed; and when people asked me why, under the circumstances, I hadn't retreated instead of standing firm and then attacking, I could honestly say that it had never occurred to me. But it did leave me badly shaken for nearly a week, and I'm sure that if I hadn't exorcized it by going back, the jungle would have beaten me.</p>
