                    <section id="introduction">
                        <p>The small village police post of Pasir Kemudi, midway between Kuantan and Sungei Lembing, was a wooden building encased in sandbags. My quarters consisted of a Malay shack, built on stilts. The police officer I took over from had been relieved of his duties because of a nervous breakdown. The one narrow dirt road that led to Kuantan twisted and turned through the jungle, and had often been ambushed; many Malay police had been killed on it. Whenever I used it, I opened fire with the bren-gun into any likely ambush position, just in case. I was 23, very green, and very scared.</p>
                        
                        <p>At night, in my atap hut, I used to jam the door with furniture, and put the bren-gun on the table at the ready. When I lit the paraffin lamp to read, I squatted on the floor out of sight, so as not to present a sitting target. The area was under the control of the Communist 10th Regiment; this, unlike the other Communist formations throughout Malaya (which were largely recruited from the Chinese), was made up mainly of Malays. As far as I was concerned in those early days, there could well have been a terrorist behind every tree.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section id="jungle-apprenticeship">
                        <p>I had to turn native overnight. I washed in the river alongside the villagers and learnt to adapt my diet to one of rice with everything. I could not speak the language and could just about make myself understood - or more often misunderstood.</p>
                        
                        <p>While I was at Pasir Kemudi I served my apprenticeship in jungle-craft. Most days I would take a small patrol out, just to get the feel of the terrain: almost at once I found I was attracted by the jungle; something seemed to hold me fast to it. I couldn't, I still can't, fully describe the fascination it exerted on me, but it was very real. This was in spite of the fact that often, after a number of hours patrolling, my navigation came unstuck. One problem was that I always thought I had walked further than I actually had. It takes a long time to appreciate just how slow one's progress through heavy rain forest can be - at worst, perhaps only half a dozen miles in a day. I shall never forget the first night I spent in the jungle. I had no proper kit and only a small groundsheet to lie on. I tried to make some sort of cover out of palm fronds, but my work proved absolutely useless and when it rained, just after dark, my thick brown army blanket and everything else became sodden within minutes. I sat up, wet and shivering, and spent a miserable night being attacked by mosquitoes.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section id="first-experiences">
                        <p>It was on one of these apprentice patrols that I came across my first Communist camp. The occupants, about ten of them, happened to be away, which was undoubtedly lucky for me. I had failed to notice the give-away signs that we were approaching a camp; and the language problem prevented the few men who were with me from voicing their suspicions. As a result, I found myself standing inside the Communist stronghold before I realized it. Inside the shelters we found some haversacks, which we removed (we heard later that they contained important documents). While I was rummaging through one of them, I came across a small tin containing some sort of powder. Before any of the men could stop me, I had tipped it out on the ground - how was I to know that it was opium!</p>
                        
                        <p>On another occasion, out on a five-day patrol, I blundered into a huge camp not far from the Sungei Reman. It had accommodation for at least 100 and must have been evacuated only a few hours before we arrived. Little did I realize, as we took refuge for the night in a cave on the side of a huge limestone outcrop, with insect-infested ground to lie on and bats flying around our heads, how lucky we had been. When I eventually got the news of the camp back to Kuantan police headquarters, they sent for me straight away and interrogated me closely. I told them about the number of bashas, the parade ground and all the rest of it and they listened in amazement. Apparently, I had stumbled across the HQ of the 10th Regiment, which the Gurkhas had vainly spent weeks searching for. If the camp had been occupied, my small ill-equipped patrol would have been wiped out to a man!</p>
                        
                        <p>In retrospect, I would say it was sheer folly to send untrained young men like me into the jungle. Still, with each patrol my jungle-craft and navigation skills improved, as did my knowledge of the Malay language. There would be no more of those embarrassing incidents like the time when I tried to halt the patrol in order to relieve myself, and they obediently followed me. After almost eight months, I felt I had acquired the necessary skills, and I applied for a transfer to a jungle company as a platoon commander. This was where the real war against the Communists was being fought.</p>

                    <section id="career-background">
                        <p>When I first joined the Malayan Police in May 1952, I had had absolutely no experience of warfare, let alone the very specialized kind of warfare that was being waged against the terrorists of the Malayan Communist Party, the MCP.</p>
                        
                        <p>Born in North Staffordshire, I left school at fourteen and was apprenticed as a fitter at the locomotive works at Crewe. Although I enjoyed the work, I had a yearning for adventure and wild country, especially jungle; and not realizing that that was the one thing I shouldn't find there, I applied to join the Palestine Police. This, of course, was before the creation of the State of Israel, and the job was to keep the peace between the Palestinians and Israeli terrorist organizations like Ergun Zwei Leumi - a situation rather like the present one in Ulster. However, I was rejected - on the grounds that I wasn't heavy enough!</p>
                        
                        <p>After National Service, working on plant and equipment with the REME entirely in the UK, I found my longing to travel was as strong as ever; and so, instead of going back to the engine-shops, I went to sea as a junior engineer with Ellerman Lines. For two years the City of Poona took me all over the world; but then I was sent to engineering college in Liverpool. Three months of that was quite enough, and when I saw an advertisement for vacancies in the Malayan Police I applied, and - having put on some weight - was accepted. With three other 'new boys' - Alec Wilmott, an artist, Joe O'Brian, ex-para, and Paul Bonney, an RAF pilot (but he didn't take to it and soon opted out) - I flew out to Singapore in a Constellation in May 1952.</p>
                        
                        <p>In the naval barracks there, we kicked our heels for a fortnight and then were sent to Tanjong Kling on the Malacca coast before going off to join a unit. While we were there we never went into the jungle, were given no training and never even fired a weapon. That's what I meant when I said that on my first posting to Kuantan, Pahang, I was green. In fact, because of my sea background, the first posting I was offered when I arrived in Malaya was with the Marine Police on Penang Island. When I turned it down, the jaw of the elderly police superintendent who was interviewing me dropped in sheer disbelief. He leant back in his chair, to get the full effect of the slowly turning fan on the ceiling above his head, and stared at me.</p>
                        
                        <p>'You mean you do not want the Penang posting?'</p>
                        <p>'That is correct, Sir,' I said.</p>
                        <p>'I can't believe it, most people would do anything to get it. Anything. With your experience, ideal . . . why won't you take it?'</p>
                        <p>'Well, Sir, I joined the Malay Police to fight the Communists, not mess about in little boats.'</p>
                        <p>'I see, want excitement, adventure, is that it?'</p>
                        <p>'Yes, Sir.'</p>
                        <p>'You remind me of myself when I was a young man,' he said, and proceeded to give me his military and police autobiography. Eventually he said, 'Leave it with me.' I saluted and left.</p>
                        
                        <p>Several hours later he sent for me again.</p>
                        <p>'I've been on to Kuala Lumpur. They've granted your request. They are posting you to Kuantan, Pahang on the east coast.'</p>
                        <p>'Thank you, Sir.' I hesitated. 'What's it like there Sir?'</p>
                        <p>'Grim. Bloody grim, Follows. Communists are running the place . . . do as they please.' He shook his head, but whether it was because of the Communists, or me, I didn't know. After a pause, he went on: 'Your two years' National Service won't have prepared you for this show. It's a dirty, dangerous war; ask anyone who was here in 1942, '43 or '44, they'll tell you.'</p>
                        <p>'Yes Sir,' I said. To me, even the words 'Pahang Kuantan' had a mysterious ring to them. 'When do I leave?'</p>
                        <p>'You'll fly up in four days' time. Good luck Follows.' He stood up and shook me by the hand, 'You'll need it.'</p>
                        <p>How right he was!</p>

                    <section id="malayan-conflict">
                        <p>Here I should perhaps say something about why we were involved in this conflict at all. Although the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) dates back to 1922, only after World War 2 did it move into action and try to take over the country. During the Japanese occupation it was the Communists, through the guerrilla groups of their Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army, the MPAJA, who formed the most effective opposition to the occupying troops. Ironically, the members of the MPAJA were provided with arms by the British; and, although they were supposed to hand them in after the Japanese surrender, most of them were hidden for future use - against us. Their campaign to take over the country, backed by both Moscow and China (the majority of their members were Chinese), began immediately with attempts to infiltrate and manipulate the emerging trade unions first in Singapore, then on the mainland of Malaya, but they soon turned to open violence. In June 1948, three European planters were murdered by a Chinese Communist gang near Ipoh and a State of Emergency was declared. Their attempt, soon afterwards, to create a Communist-controlled 'Liberated Area' around Kota Bharu, on the north-east coast, was so soundly defeated, however, that they were forced to retreat into the jungle. There, through an unpleasant mixture of propaganda and terror, they attempted to organize enough popular support to challenge, and eventually overthrow, the Government. Because, for nearly 80 years, Malaya - or the Federated Malay States, as it was known - had been under British protection, and because, with its valuable assets of Singapore, as a base, and rubber and tin from its estates and mines, it was a jewel in the Imperial Crown, and because the West felt the importance of resisting Communism wherever it surfaced, the British were bound to become involved.</p>
                        
                        <p>There were two main forces fighting the CTs; one was the army and the other was the Malayan Police. Army units, notably the Gurkhas, but also Fijians, King's African Rifles, Sarawak Rangers, and a number of regular battalions from Britain, fought there, many of the last including soldiers doing their National Service. The Police Field Force, the operational arm of the Malayan Police - to which I belonged - was composed mainly of Malays, with mainly British officers, though while I was there more and more Malays were being commissioned.</p>
                        
                        <p>Vernon Bartlett, writing in 1953 - the year I went to Yong Peng had this to say:</p>
                        
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>the CTs are most definitely on the defensive; they, more often than the police or the soldiers, are the victims of ambushes.</p>
                            <p>... Patrols by the Police Field Force or the army are increasingly effective, but a man does an average of 700 hours 'jungle-bashing' before he kills a Communist.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        
                        <p>This story deals, as it must, with the highlights of my five and a half years in the jungle. The reader must use his imagination to fill in the hundreds of hours of 'jungle-bashing' that came between the events I describe. Soldiering there, as always everywhere, is 99 per cent boredom and 1 per cent excitement.</p>
                        
                        <p>In due course I was informed that my request for a posting had been granted and I was told to report to Cha'ah in North Johore.</p>
