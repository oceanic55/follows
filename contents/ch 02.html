                <h2>Chapter 2: From a View to Kill</h2>
                <div class="article-content">
                    <section id="introduction">
                        <p>The Labis-Yong Peng area of North Johore was overrun with Communist terrorists (CTs); Cha'ah, to which I had been posted, was the centre of their activities. The 10th Police Jungle Coy, in which I was now a platoon commander, was one of the units specializing in deep jungle penetration, and we were properly equipped for our role of seeking out and destroying Communist hide-outs. Where, earlier, the CTs had been safe in their lairs to which, having attacked a police station or ambushed a Security Forces (SF) patrol, they could retreat unmolested, this was no longer the case. Companies like the 10th Police could stay in the jungle for weeks, supplied by air, and could take the battle into the heart of the enemy's country. I was to be with this company for 21 months.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section id="opposing-forces">
                        <p>Our main opponents at Cha'ah were the 7th CT Platoon under its Political Commissar, Goh Peng Tuan, and the numerous Communist cells in the local villages. Goh Peng's gang were killers and absolutely ruthless. Several times we were ordered out to bring back their victims; normally it would be one of the rubber estate workers, men whose job is to tap the latex from the rubber trees. More often than not they had been horribly tortured before being murdered. The usual reason behind the killings was the refusal of the villagers to pay the monthly subscription demanded by the Communists. When, on one of these grim sorties, I found that the man concerned had been mutilated and killed in the presence of his wife and son, I swore that, one day, I would make the CTs pay for their revolting crimes.</p>

                        <p>Several times during those weeks I found camps which had been abandoned by 7th Platoon, so it appeared that they were keeping on the move in order to give us the slip. Our first real chance went awry by a stroke of misfortune. I had disguised three or four of the Chinese members of my platoon as CTs, and with them as the lure I had laid a trap which should have bagged the entire outfit. What's more, they very nearly walked straight into it. Unfortunately a party of rubber tappers saw us and gave the terrorists warning of our presence. But there was always a next time. As it happened, the District Committee Member's mother and younger brother lived in the village, and I knew them both by sight. One day the mother was caught smuggling dog flesh (the Chinese believe it cures malaria) out of the village, which meant that the District Committee Member was ill in his jungle camp. I knew this from an informer of mine; so I saw the brother and asked him why they had been meeting him, but he feigned innocence.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section id="leaflet-operation">
                        <p>One of our weapons against the CTs was a leaflet calling on them to give themselves up. If they did, and behaved themselves, their crimes would be overlooked and they would be handsomely treated. If they did not, they could be sure their days were numbered. Literally thousands of these sheets were distributed, the bulk of them from the air, and they had some effect, the more so as the Security Forces started to get the upper hand. I now gave one to the brother.</p>

                        <p>'Next time you see the district committee member,' I said, 'give him this. Tell him that if he doesn't come out of the jungle and give himself up, I shall kill him.'</p>

                        <p>Nothing happened. Then, several days later, Police Lieutenant George Brown and I, with a small party, were making our way back towards the main trunk road, after a short patrol, to meet the transport to take us back to camp. My diary describes what happened next:</p>
                    </section>

                    <section id="august-encounter">
                        <h3>August 1953</h3>
                        <p>Walking through an oil palm estate about 20 yards from the road, saw a group of armed figures in the lalang on the opposite side to us. They were also walking towards the road, but seemed unaware of our presence. Only about 50 yards separated us. I knew it must be the district committee member and his men.</p>

                        <p>We dropped to the ground and crawled forward until we reached the road. As we jumped to our feet the leading CT spotted us. Instantly he took aim at me and fired, but his shot whistled harmlessly past my body. Not giving him a second chance, I let off several rounds with my carbine. I saw him stagger and fall, so I knew my bullets had found their mark. Brown, too, was giving them the works. Also the other chaps were doing their best, especially Corporal Togom with his bren-gun. As we charged amongst them, our men were shouting 'Bunoh! - Bunoh!' ('Kill! Kill!').</p>

                        <p>Coming upon a mortally wounded CT I bent down to relieve him of his weapon. At that moment a sten-gunner, before I had the chance to stop him, fired a long burst at point-blank range into the man's head. His skull made a horrifying sound as bullets blasted it open. Just like a small explosion, his head burst apart, particles of brain spattered into my face, but I didn't care. A female CT started running towards one of her fallen comrades; I fired a couple of warning shots in her direction, but she carried on. In a flash she grabbed the dead man's weapon. As she was making her getaway, I took careful aim at her: I wanted to wound and capture, not kill. Gently I squeezed the trigger. She clutched her arm and let out a blood-curdling scream; I knew my aim had been a good one. As I tried for another shot I heard the familiar metallic click of an empty magazine. Before I had time to reload she had fled into the nearby jungle.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section id="aftermath">
                        <p>After the last shot had been fired, silence fell. We dragged the four dead bodies to the roadside and awaited police transport. Brown, myself and the chaps congratulated each other on our success. It seemed like a miracle that not one of us had been harmed.</p>

                        <p>Within 15 minutes the police transport arrived. Callously, we flung the bullet-riddled CTs into the armoured car. Suddenly, the sight of their blood-soaked bodies filled me with disgust. I turned away and retched.</p>

                        <p>On our arrival at Cha'ah police station, the four dead men were soon identified as being the District Committee Member and some of his outfit. The woman who had escaped was Goh Peng Tuan's wife. Although she was a Communist and a terrorist, I could not help but admire her courage. Later, she was killed, along with him and many of his followers, when their camp was bombed by the RAF.</p>

                        <p>All the village seemed to turn out to stare at the corpses. Amongst the crowd I noticed the late District Committee Member's brother, so I made my way to where he was standing.</p>

                        <p>'Apparently your brother paid no heed to my message,' I said.</p>

                        <p>He didn't answer.</p>

                        <p>I then told him that if he was thinking of joining the Communists to seek revenge he had better think again. 'If you do,' I went on, 'these local people will be viewing your dead body, so remember my warning.' With that I left him to think it over.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section id="platoon-life">
                        <p>Here I should say something about my platoon, for in jungle warfare, perhaps even more than in a 'conventional' battle, every man's life depends on the discipline, steadiness and trigger-sharp reactions of everyone else.</p>

                        <p>We usually patrolled in small units, ten or a dozen, lived on the same rice and dried fish, and mucked in together - and sometimes almost starved together - so the sense of comradeship was very strong, and differences of rank applied only in normal operational conditions.</p>

                        <p>My right-hand man while I was at Cha'ah was Sergeant Shaffie. He was a little chap, no more than 5' 6", a Malay from Batu Pahat in Johore, and as soon as I met him I took to him. He was five years older than I, and like all Malays he smiled easily and often; but there was a steadiness and honesty about his face, especially in the eyes, which suggested great strength of character. When I arrived at Cha'ah he had already been a 'jungle cop' for five years. He had a fine record, and had no wish to return to normal police duties. No one was better at steadying the men when morale began to slip in appalling conditions, or when food was running out. Shaffie and I would often share our meagre rations, eating off the same leaf - washing up was not a problem in the jungle! - and drinking from the same water-bottle; but never did he take advantage of his position. What little English he spoke had a flavour all its own, and we normally conversed in Malay.</p>

                        <p>When we were on patrol he had a characteristic way of pointing out something. He didn't use his hand or his finger; instead, he would tilt his head back slightly, purse his lips and point his chin in the direction he wanted me to look, murmuring 'Sanah Tuan' ('There, Sir'). I never had the least difficulty in seeing what he was indicating. When I called a halt, I, and the others, would flop down exhausted, but not Shaffie. He would be off prowling around, searching for clues. He taught me a great deal about jungle-craft.</p>

                        <p>'Tuan, don't just look at the jungle round you. Try to look through it. Right through the tangle. You will see much further. Sniff the air for the smells of human habitation. Listen for the noises that don't belong.'</p>

                        <p>And it was true. By not simply staring at the immediate green curtains that closed us in all round, but by doing as he said, looking through it, you did see several yards further. Similarly, with use and training, all your senses became sharpened; you became, I suppose, that much closer to the instinctive reactions of aboriginal peoples. I was to see more of this later, when I was with the tribes in central Malaya; but it was Sergeant Shaffie who was my true mentor.</p>

                        <p>Another regular member of my 'team' was Jo-Jo, our cook, handyman, and, when occasion demanded, doctor. Jo-Jo was a Malay Chinese, with that people's ability to adapt to any condition without complaint. Although he had had little contact with Europeans, he quickly fell in with my ways. At those times when I took only a small patrol out with me, Jo-Jo used to stay behind, which he hated as much as I did. I missed the mugs of hot tea he seemed to be able to produce under the most unlikely conditions. He also used to keep our encampments shipshape, and was in charge of the water point and the latrine. Jo-Jo was a country boy and improvization was his forte; particularly with regard to cooking. The raw materials he had to work with were uninspiring - rice was the staple, with whatever else we could forage or carry - yet he did wonders with them. He was also our medicine man. In his pack he invariably carried that great cure-all, 'Tiger Balm', as well as a variety of herbs, out of which he could quickly concoct evil, yet remarkably effective cures for our jungle maladies.</p>

                        <p>After everyone had had his fair quota of drink, someone suggested a dice game called 'The Drunken Coachman'. Foolishly, I agreed to join in. The first person to throw six aces orders any mixture of drinks he likes. The second person to throw six aces has to pay for it, and the third unlucky blighter has to drink it. I was the 'unlucky blighter' in the first round. Some of the mixtures that were drunk during this game were incredible, and I'm sure that if there had been a tin of Brasso behind the counter that would have been included too. I managed to swallow the 'Devil's cocktail' dreamed up by the first chap and felt the room spinning round me. Very soon afterwards, I decided I had better leave. I staggered back to my quarters and threw myself onto the bed, there to sleep the sleep of the plastered for the rest of the night. It was one way of dissolving the tensions of an operation.</p>
