# Roy Follows, a biography.

## Introduction
Roy Follows (c. 1928–2013) was a British author and former police officer whose life exemplified adventure, courage, and literary contribution. Born in Newcastle-under-Lyme, England, Follows embarked on a remarkable journey from his early global travels to his distinguished service in the Malayan Emergency and a daring overland expedition from Singapore to England. His experiences are vividly captured in his two published works, *Jungle Beat: Fighting Terrorists in Malaya* and *Four Wheels and Frontiers: The First Overland-Singapore to England*, which serve as primary sources for understanding his extraordinary life. This unified biography integrates recent findings, notably confirming his passing on September 1, 2013, and refines details from credible sources to present a comprehensive, university-level portrait of his legacy.

## Early Life and Formative Years
Roy Follows was born around 1928 in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, England, where his childhood was shaped by a deep fascination with exploration. Inspired by encounters with Foreign Legion members adorned with badges from around the world, he developed an early passion for travel. At the age of 16, Follows left school to join the armed forces, embarking on global adventures that saw him circumnavigate the world three times by age 19, likely between 1944 and 1947. This extraordinary feat, accomplished in an era before widespread long-haul travel and vaccinations against tropical diseases, highlighted his boldness and curiosity, laying the foundation for his later achievements.

## Service in the Malayan Emergency
In 1950, at the age of 22, Follows sought further adventure by joining the Royal Malaya Police during the Malayan Emergency (1948–1960), a guerrilla conflict against the communist Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA). Serving for approximately nine years, with over five years dedicated to jungle operations, he was primarily stationed with the 10th Police Jungle Company and the 4th Police Field Force in Johor. Within a year, he distinguished himself as the youngest commander of a jungle fort, specifically Fort Brooke near Gua Musang, Kelantan, Malaysia. His book, *Jungle Beat* (Eye Books, 1999, first published 1990), provides a gripping memoir of these experiences, detailing the relentless challenges of jungle warfare, including encounters with wildlife such as stampeding elephants, swarming ants, and prowling tigers, alongside the human threat of insurgents. As a Police Lieutenant, Follows led offensive patrols in enemy-controlled territory, relying on limited intelligence, and contributed to psychological operations, such as the "Jack In The Box" leaflet campaigns aimed at demoralizing communist supporters. He was critical of the reward system for defectors, noting its role in incentivizing betrayal with monetary rewards, enabling some to amass wealth under new identities in Singapore, Malaysia, and Australia. Follows also played a role in the Special Operation Volunteer Force (SOVF), a unit formed in 1953 comprising ex-communists who conducted tactical and psychological operations against their former comrades. His photograph of a Malayan Police patrol at Fort Brooke, shared in earlier correspondence, underscores his significant contributions to the counterinsurgency efforts during the Emergency.

## Overland Journey from Singapore to England
In 1958, following his service in Malaya, Follows embarked on an audacious overland journey from Singapore to England alongside another English Colonial Police Officer. Traveling in an ex-army Willy’s Jeep purchased from a local scrapyard, they navigated challenging terrains through Burma, India, Pakistan, Iran, and Eastern Europe without modern conveniences like GPS or mobile phones. This expedition, undertaken during a period of relative global stability but significant logistical challenges, is chronicled in *Four Wheels and Frontiers* (Ulric Publishing, 2005). The book captures their resourcefulness, adventurous spirit, and cultural observations of the regions traversed, cementing Follows' legacy as a trailblazer. The journey, a testament to his enduring passion for exploration, remains a highlight of his adventurous life.

## Literary Contributions
Follows’ two published works, *Jungle Beat* and *Four Wheels and Frontiers*, are essential sources for understanding his life and contributions. *Jungle Beat* (Eye Books, 1999, with an earlier edition possibly published by Travellerseye in 1990) offers a detailed account of his Malayan Police service, once required reading for officers preparing for jungle operations, as noted in a review on [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Jungle-Beat-Roy-Follows/dp/0953057577). The book highlights the effectiveness of intelligence and ground patrols during the Malayan Emergency, earning praise for its engaging narrative and historical insights, as seen in reviews on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1851359.Jungle_Beat). *Four Wheels and Frontiers* (2005) narrates his 1958 overland journey, blending adventure with historical context and cultural observations, as evidenced by reader feedback on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2870544-four-wheels-and-frontiers). Both works, published by Eye Books and Ulric Publishing respectively, have been lauded for their storytelling and historical value, contributing significantly to the literature on British colonial history and adventure travel.

## Later Life and Passing
Roy Follows retired to Porthill, near Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, UK, where he lived with his wife, Doris, and was father to daughters Jayne and Helen. Correspondence documented on the [Cameron Highland Destination](https://www.cameron-highland-destination.com/jungle-beat-roy-follows-fort-brooke.html) website, published on October 18, 2020, mentioned “recent” interactions with Follows, including shared operational maps and reflections on his time at Fort Brooke. Initially, this suggested he was alive in 2020, but further investigation revealed a death notice from the *Stoke Sentinel* ([Funeral Notices - Roy FOLLOWS](https://funeral-notices.co.uk/notice/follows/2984487)), confirming he passed away on September 1, 2013, at age 84, at Douglas Macmillan Hospice in Blurton, Staffordshire. The notice, published on September 9, 2013, by CO-OPERATIVE FUNERALCARE, Wolstanton, aligns with his estimated birth year (c. 1928, making him 84 or 85 in 2013) and residence in Porthill. The 2020 correspondence likely reflects republished earlier interactions, as the website’s use of “republish” and the absence of new publications or activity post-2005 support this conclusion. No evidence of additional books or activities after 2013 was found, reinforcing that Follows was deceased by 2020. His retirement years were marked by reflection on his past, as evidenced by his shared memories and photographs, but no confirmed new writing projects emerged after *Four Wheels and Frontiers*.

## Legacy
Roy Follows’ life is a compelling narrative of courage, exploration, and literary achievement. His service in the Malayan Emergency, his daring 1958 overland journey, and his ability to document these experiences in *Jungle Beat* and *Four Wheels and Frontiers* have left a lasting impact. His books provide valuable historical insights into British colonial efforts and the Malayan Emergency while inspiring readers with tales of resilience and adventure. The clarification of his passing on September 1, 2013, resolves earlier discrepancies regarding his status in 2020, ensuring an accurate portrayal of his life’s timeline. Follows remains a figure of inspiration, his stories preserving the spirit of adventure and contributing to the historical and literary record of a pivotal era.
